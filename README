---------------------

The purpose of this document is to outline the testing strategy and overall approach for the WFG Hypervolume project. 
This includes test case derivation techniques, both fundamental approaches (functional and structural),
with detailexplanations to why the chosen methods were selected.The focus of the test cases is to evaluate the compliance of the entire system, 
giving a sense of validation that every unit of the project is performing to the provided specifications. 

The cases arecovering the performance and reliability of the system, this includes recording user interaction, 
data output and the speed in which the program performs the task.
